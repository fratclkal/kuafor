                            <dt>Is it OK if I am a few minutes late for my appointment?</dt>
                            <dd>We schedule clients on the half-hour and we make full use of those 30 minutes with each client. If someone is 5 minutes late for their appointment, it affects every client after them, as well as the barber who is trying to stay on schedule. For example, if the client after you has a 12:30 appointment (expecting to be out by 1:00 so that he can be back to work on time), and his appointment doesn't end up starting until 12:35-12:40, he could end up being late for work and possibly suffer the consequences of this.  Beyond practical factors such as this, it is simply common courtesy to arrive a couple of minutes ahead of your appointment. If this doesn't work for you and your schedule, then we encourage you to stop in as a walk-in.</dd>
                            <dt>What is your appointment policy?</dt>
                            <dd>If you need to cancel your appointment, please do so as far in advance as possible, preferably at least one hour.  Our appointment policy is listed on the appointment page.</dd>
                            <dt>When do you take your last walk-in?</dt>
                            <dd>Our walk-in list closes when there are as many customers waiting as we can serve before closing time.  It may reopen if customers leave the line.  Sometimes we continue accepting clients until a bit past advertised closing time, and sometimes the list gets full and closes an hour early (or more).</dd>
